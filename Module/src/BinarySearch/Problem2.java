    /* Ceil in a Sorted Array(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ceil-in-a-sorted-array/1)
Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x,
find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x.
This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1.
The index of the first occurrence is 0.*/
